- short for templates

- a cabinet of _kinda_ helpful scripts that (may or may not) improve your workflow

## How to use:

- clone this repo to your cluster home directory 

```bash

git clone https://github.com/van-richard/PL888.git
```

- `source` the file, `PL888/env.sh` to fix permissions on Pete, add my custom modules, and scripts
